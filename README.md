Practicing

CSS (Positioning, Animation)
Vanilla JS (Event Listeners, set attributes/ toggle classes)
What I Learned:

"removeEventListener accepts a function that was previously added as a listener with addEventListener, not a callback. For this reason it is not practical to use anonymous functions as listeners - they cannot be removed."
using "overflow: hidden" to disable scrolling
using "white-space: nowrap;" to have text inside a button sit on the same row
