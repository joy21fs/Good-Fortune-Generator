Practicing

- CSS (Positioning, Animation)
- Vanilla JS (Event Listeners, set attributes/ toggle classes)

What I Learned:

- "removeEventListener accepts a function that was previously added as a listener with addEventListener, not a callback. For this reason it is not practical to use anonymous functions as listeners - they cannot be removed."
- using "overflow: hidden" to disable scrolling
- using "white-space: nowrap;" to have text inside a button sit on the same row
- improving animation performances with will-change property and svg
